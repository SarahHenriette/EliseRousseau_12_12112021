# SPORTSEE
I worked as a developer at SportSee, a startup dedicated to sports coaching. In full growth, the company will today launch a new version of the user profile page. This page will in particular allow the user to follow the number of sessions carried out as well as the number of calories burned.

* A code editor such as VSCode, VSCodium or SublimeText.
* NodeJS. See NodeJs website for installation instructions

# Installation
1. To run it locally, you need to [install the back-end](https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/P9-front-end-dashboard), you just have to follow the instructions in the previous link.

2. Download or fork this repository.

3. Launch the back-end, it might use the port localhost:3000.
